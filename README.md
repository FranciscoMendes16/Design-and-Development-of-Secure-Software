# Design-and-Development-of-Secure-Software

The aim of this course is to provide knowledge on advanced techniques for the development of secure software. 
The concepts that should be mastered are: the different aspects of developing software with security requirements, being able to identify existing alternatives and selecting and implementing the most adequate ones. 
The course considers the different phases of the software development lifecycle, from requirements engineering to testing. 
Beyond acquiring knowledge on the fundamentals of the area, students are expected to gain competences in the analysis, design, development and validation of secure software through their application in real-world case studies.

This subject has two main Projects:

- Software Security Requirements

- Secure Coding and Vulnerability Detection
